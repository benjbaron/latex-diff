This project aims to remove the `\add{}` and `\del{}` tags in Latex documents that contain modifications outlined by the two tags:
 - `\add{}` to outline an *addition*
 - `\del{}` to outline a *deletion*
 
 The script will parse the root file given as output and remove all the tags, while preserving the embeded commands.
